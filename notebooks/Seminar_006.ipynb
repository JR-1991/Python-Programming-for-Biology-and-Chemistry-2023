    "- What is needed to create a DNA Sequence object? --> Arguments of the `__init__`\n",
    "- How can we set up the attributes?\n",
    "    - Simple assignment from the argument to the attribute --> `self.sequence = sequence`\n",
    "    - Or do something with argument, where the result is assigned to an attribute --> `self.gc_content`\n",
    "    \n",
    "With this type of \"recursion\", we can now create `DNASequence` objects by passing the `sequence` argument and its appropriate value (the gene). In return we store the sequence of course, but we also calculate the GC content since we have specified this in our `__init__`-method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the power of object-oriented programming, because we can be explicit about what makes up a DNA sequence without the user having to do all these calculations for us. In addition, we could derive far more information and all the user has to do is pass a sequence. Ultimately, the user can now access all the attributes and do something nice with it.\n",
